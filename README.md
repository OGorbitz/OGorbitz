My name is Ozzie Gorbitz, I am a Tennessee based software developer. I have practiced multiple disciplines of software development ranging from server administration to app-development. I am self-taught, having started with Java around 12 years ago.

Contained within are some of my projects. My most current one is a game made in C# with a private repository. Videos can be seen on my website. I also have a site using Angular and ASP.Net.
